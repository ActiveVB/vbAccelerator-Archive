# vbAccelerator-Archive
A last-ditch attempt to archive the venerable vbAccelerator website (and code samples), which disappeared from the web in November 2015.  Thank you to [vbForums user fafalone] (http://www.vbforums.com/showthread.php?812569-vbAccelerator-site-gone) for having the foresight to archive everything in advance.  This archive is based off his work.

The original vbAccelerator website and code samples were provided under a [Generic CC 1.0 Attribution license] (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/1.0/), so barring additional information on a particular page or .zip file, that license should cover the entirety of the repository.

All text, code, and images are assumed Copyright Â© 2004 Steve McMahon, vbAccelerator Ltd, per the original site footer.  Many thanks to to Steve for his valuable work, and for keeping his site online as long as he did.
